#summary Getting started with Avahi4J
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Quick start guide =

The following steps have been tested with Ubuntu Hardy and should remain unchanged for later versions.
{{{
sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk ant libavahi-client-dev 
svn co http://avahi4j.googlecode.com/svn/avahi4j/trunk avahi4j
ant clean all test-browse
}}}
In another terminal, run 
{{{
cd avahi4j
ant test-publish
}}}
Press Enter and check the published service being resolved in the first terminal.

The above steps:
 * download Avahi4J in the avahi4j/ directory,
 * install Open JDK 6, Ant and the Avahi client development files,
 * compile Avahi4J
 * run a sample application which browse for services of type "_test._tcp"
 * run a sample application which publishes a "_test._tcp" service on the local machine.

= Installation =
Once you have successfully compiled Avahi4J and ran the sample applications, you can install Avahi4J on your machine by running with
{{{
sudo ant install
}}}
by default, this will copy `avahi4j.jar` in `/usr/share/java` and the JNI library `libavahi4j.so` in `/usr/lib/jni`.

= Using Avahi4J in your own program =
Avahi4J JavaDoc can be generated using
{{{
ant javadoc
}}}

Once Avahi4J has been installed, you can start using it in your own program. The only requirement is that you add `avahi4j.jar` to your classpath, and that you add the directory where the JNI library is located to the `java.library.path` property.

This can be done by adding the following arguments when running the JVM:
{{{
-classpath /usr/share/java -Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni
}}}
